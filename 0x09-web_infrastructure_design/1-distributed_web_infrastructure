# Key Explanations:
- Why extra servers? For redundancy, load balancing, and separation of concerns.

- Load Balancer (HAProxy): Distributes traffic across app servers.

- Load-Balancing Algorithm: e.g., Round Robin or Least Connections.

- Active-Active vs Active-Passive:

- Active-Active: All servers process traffic simultaneously.

- Active-Passive: One handles traffic, others wait as backups.

- Primary-Replica DB:

- Primary: Handles writes.

- Replica(s): Sync from primary, used for read operations.

# Issues:
- SPOF: The load balancer or DB is still a SPOF unless clustered.

- Security: No firewalls or HTTPS.

- No Monitoring: No visibility into performance or failures.
