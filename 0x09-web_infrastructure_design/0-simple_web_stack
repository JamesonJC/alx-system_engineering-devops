# Key Explanations:
- Server: A physical or virtual machine that hosts components of the web application.

- Domain Name: foobar.com is a human-readable address mapped to an IP (8.8.8.8).

- DNS Record: The www is a subdomain and a CNAME or A record.

- Web Server (Nginx): Accepts HTTP requests and forwards to the app server.

- Application Server: Runs your business logic (PHP, Node.js, Python, etc.).

- Application Files: Your actual codebase served by the app server.

- Database (MySQL): Stores user and app data.

- Communication Protocol: Typically HTTP over TCP/IP.

# Issues:
- SPOF (Single Point of Failure): One server â€” if it dies, the entire app dies.

- Downtime during Maintenance: Updating code or restarting server causes downtime.

- No Scalability: Can't handle increased traffic alone.
