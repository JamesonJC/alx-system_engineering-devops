MONITORING:
- Each server has monitoring agent (e.g., SumoLogic)
- Sends logs/metrics to monitoring system


# Key Additions:
- Firewalls: Protect from unauthorized access.

- HTTPS (SSL): Encrypt traffic from user to load balancer.

- Monitoring Clients: Collect logs, metrics, alerts.

- Monitoring Tool: E.g., SumoLogic, Datadog, Prometheus.

# Extra Concepts:
- QPS (Queries per Second): Can be monitored by logging NGINX requests or database queries.

- Why SSL at Load Balancer is a concern?:

- SSL termination here means internal traffic isn’t encrypted unless re-encrypted.

- Single MySQL for writes: Still a bottleneck and SPOF.

- Same components on all servers: Harder to scale/manage — separation of roles is better.
